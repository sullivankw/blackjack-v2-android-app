1. practice mode classes for the next release.....do in kotlin, bottom nav, switch with the tab layouts???
2. lock ui for network call?
3. add module(JAR) to handle non network nec....since only client is android atm
4. rename stuff and package into appropriate packages
5. fix aligment of the buttons 
6. is the 'clever' subclassing overkill?
7. add lifecycle awareness?
