# blackjack helper android app #

* D/L available in the play store at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sullivankw.blackjackhelper
* HELP! If anyone is interested in creating an ios version of this app, the REST API can be found here: https://github.com/sullivankw/spring-boot-blackjack-api. Currently, this Android version is running off a jar with the services of that API. It's only a couple clicks away though to get it up in running in Azure for you to code against.
